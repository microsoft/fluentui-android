## Colors and typography

Fluent UI for Android provides [colors](FluentUI/src/main/res/values/colors.xml) and [typography](FluentUI/src/main/res/values/styles_font.xml) based on the Fluent design language.

## Controls

Fluent UI for Android includes an expanding library of controls written in Kotlin. These controls implement the Fluent design language and bring consistency across Office app experiences.

Some of the controls available include:
- AvatarView
- Button styles
- BottomSheet
- CalendarView
- CircularProgress styles
- DateTimePickerDialog
- Drawer
- ListItemView
- PeoplePickerView
- PersonaChipView
- PersonaListView
- PersonaView
- Snackbar
- TemplateView
- Tooltip

A full list of currently supported controls can be found here: [FluentUI](FluentUI/src/main/java/com/microsoft/fluentui).

## Install and use Fluent UI

### Requirements

API 21+

### 1. Using Gradle

- Our library is published through JCenter, so make sure the `jcenter()` repository has been added to your project level build.gradle file (which usually is automatic).

- Inside the dependency block in your build.gradle, add this line for the FluentUI library:
```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.microsoft.fluentui:FluentUIAndroid:$version'
    ...
}
```
- Make sure you replace `$version` with the latest version of FluentUI.

#### a) Develop for Surface-Duo:
- Please also add the following lines to your repositories section in your gradle script:
```gradle
maven {
    url "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/MicrosoftDeviceSDK/DuoSDK-Public/_packaging/Duo-SDK-Feed/maven/v1"
}
```
- Also add the SDK dependency to the module-level build.gradle file(current version may be  different
from what's shown here):
```gradle
implementation "com.microsoft.device:dualscreen-layout:1.0.0-alpha01"
```

### 2. Using Maven

- Add the FluentUI library as a dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.microsoft.fluentui</groupId>
  <artifactId>FluentUIAndroid</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
```

- Make sure you replace `${version}` with the latest version of FluentUI.

### 3. Manual installation

- Download the latest changes from the [Fluent UI Android](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-android) repository.

- Follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) to build and output an AAR file from the FluentUI module, import the module to your project, and add it as a dependency. If you're having trouble generating an AAR file for the module, make sure you select it and run "Make Module 'FluentUI'" from the Build menu.

- Some components have dependencies you will need to manually add to your app if you are using this library as an AAR artifact because these dependencies do not get included in the output.
  - If using **PeoplePickerView**, include this dependency in your gradle file:
    ```gradle
    implementation 'com.splitwise:tokenautocomplete:2.0.8'
    ```
  - If using **CalendarView** or **DateTimePickerDialog**, include this dependency in your gradle file:
    ```gradle
    implementation 'com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.1.0'
    ```
  - Double check that these library versions correspond to the latest versions we implement in the FluentUI [build.gradle](FluentUI/build.gradle).

### Import and use the library

In code:
```kotlin
import com.microsoft.fluentui.persona.AvatarView
```

In XML:
```xml
<com.microsoft.fluentui.persona.AvatarView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:name="Mona Kane" />
```

## Demo app

Included in this repository is a demo of currently implemented controls. A full list of implemented controls available in the demo can be found here:  [Demos](FluentUI.Demo/src/main/java/com/microsoft/fluentuidemo/demos).

To see samples of all of our implemented controls and design language, run the [FluentUI.Demo](FluentUI.Demo) module in Android Studio.
